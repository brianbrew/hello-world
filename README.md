First Attempt Creating a Sample Repository

My name is Brian Brew. 
I am a graduate student in the Department of Political Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
in the American politics subfield. My broad research interests include campaigns, elections, and political parties
in the United States. My current slate of research focuses on primary elections at the congressional and presidential levels.

As of this very instant (May 11, 2021), I am teaching myself how to use GitHub.
This "Hello World" prompt they put forth is actually very useful. Kudos, GitHub! If anyone would like the link:
